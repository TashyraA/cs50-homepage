            <div class="about-para">
                <p>One of my favorite hobbies that I truly enjoy is cooking! It is most certainly my second love next to
                    my daughter. I started at a young age and realized being in the kitchen was so helpful with calming
                    my anxiety. Then, I started to pick it up creating different dishes from different cultures.</p>
                <p>I went to a coding bootcamp in 2020 as a way to kill time during the pandemic just to realize I
                    genuinly loved programming. At one point I started a freelancing business creating websites for
                    those who were looking to start a business. I LOVE animation and I projected that in a lot of my
                    projects. Overall, I loved seeing my clients satisfied and confident to continue their small
                    business.</p>
